## the Basak Beykoz brand

The main difference of Basak Beykoz brand is the emphasis on human values. The brand can make the distinction that its tone is not sterile, that the client being human matters. It's not about getting ahead in professional life but more about finding your own colors, your own voice and inner peace, which then makes the world, professional life and aspirations more accessible to you.

As the service is highly dependent on the type of personality traits that the client has, it may be more beneficial to design approaches for every type that is more likely to look for the service that the brand provides.

For people who score high on conscientiousness, the aspect of building structure in their client's conduct and thinking could be the most effective strategy. People who are low on conscientiousness and feel the need to get better in this aspect would also resonate with this message, if they are weary of building structures, then they may be captured by another personality trait listed below.

People who are high on openness can be affected the messages of experiencing their life in a new way and opening themselves for seeing their own colors and true self. They are more likely to respond to messages that involve creation, thrill, noticing new things in their familiarity environment end learning to enjoy subtle things. People score low on openness may respond to messages on ethics and "what's right".

For people who seek coaching for reasons related to high neuroticism, the message that will resonate with them can be that they can find peace, their true self and experience life in a different way that is more favorable for their goals and inner peace. 

On extraversion front, people who score highly on these would, unless they are also defined by any of the traits that are mentioned above, may likely be interested in leadership, and more traditional coaching services, for this group, Basak Beykoz can communicate her skill set and past professional experience. 

Introverted people who are having trouble in their lives due to demands from them that require extraversion, may be captured by the messages that capture the high neuroticism group.

Introverted people who are happy with their nature but still want to get coaching can be captured by some other personality trait that they exhibit.

People who score high on agreeableness and aren't happy about this can be influenced by the messages of leadership, taking initiative, independence. People who are agreeable and enjoy this about themselves may be influenced by the same messages but would probably respond better to messages of learning how to use these skills more effectively. People who score low on agreeableness are more likely to oppose to any idea that they encounter during coaching and can be seen similar to people who score low on openness, they will have to be approached on some other personality trait they have.
