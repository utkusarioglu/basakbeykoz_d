## Content Analysis

The competitors see their most valuable asset to be the skill set of the professional coach. The past activities, accomplishments are mentioned in all competitor websites, as well as a testimonials as the proof of the quality of the service that the coach provides.

On websites of smaller organizations or single individuals, access is made much easier for the visitor by placing contact
information on the very top. While coaching companies that are larger in size don't seem to be as concerned about ease of access

Websites of individuals keep more active with producing content for their visitors in the form of blog articles and social media. But most of the competitors don't seem to be 
embracing the benefits of social media fully. 

There is a very wide range in the quality of the content that the coaches produce. While it's clear that they all see client attraction through sharing wisdom as an important part of their business, not many of them seem to stick to a certain tone. Most don't seem to have any principles on the structure of the articles or the social media content shared.

*Content on all the competitor websites seem to be focusing on talking at the audience, they don't give any indication that they hear what the audience is saying by visiting their website and/or social media.*

## Design Analysis
Most competitor websites are poorly designed and maintained. Design in all of them are dated and/or inconsistent with the message or the target audience. 

Social media preferences in most are out of date.

Images used in most are do not seem to connect deeply with the service provided, nor do they speak of any kind of experience that their service may be providing. At most, the imagery could be considered generic.

Content in most is not managed properly. It's very common to see wrong density of text with wrong font sizes, Wrongly scaled images and unbalanced layouts with very little thought given to whitespace.
